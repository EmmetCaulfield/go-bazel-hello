# go-bazel-hello

A “Hello World” program in Go with Bazel.

The purpose of this is to provide a simple template or starting point
for other Go projects that use Bazel as the build system: it’s
completely useless on its own.

It currently uses a legacy `WORKSPACE` file since it predates
[Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/migration) and I haven't updated
it yet.
